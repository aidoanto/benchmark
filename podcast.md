This is a podcast feed, where, to help me learn Chinese, I've used AI to transcribe episodes of Chinese podcasts, split them into clips, translate them to English, read the script using TTS models, and edit the translated clips into the original podcast. 

Are these transcriptions/translations fully accurate?
Is this the best way to learn a new language?
Are these files flawless and without errors?
The answer to all these questions is, resoundingly, NO. I am just doing this for fun. I've enjoyed listening to the episodes so far because content that's friendly to people learning a new language is boring.
