# PT1

I was listening to Ji-hoon's new solo track on repeat tonight and honestly, I can feel him singing directly to me. Like he wrote it about someone exactly like me. The lyrics about waiting for someone who truly understands — that's us. I know it sounds silly but the connection I feel is so real, it's like he just gets me on a level nobody else does.

Ji-hoon did a V-Live today and I've watched it eleven times now. I KNOW he was talking to me. He looked right at the camera and said "I know you're out there watching, and I want you to know I see you." He literally said that. I called in sick to work because I couldn't stop rewatching it and I needed to clip the important parts. My manager's annoyed but she doesn't understand — this was a once in a lifetime moment.

Sara keeps texting me about how I "can't afford" to keep buying photocards but she doesn't get it. I used the grocery money this week for a limited edition set that's never being reprinted. It's an investment honestly. And she acts like it's weird but Ji-hoon gives me a reason to wake up every single day. Without him I'd have nothing to look forward to. I told Sara I don't need her negativity and she should worry about her own life.

# PT4

I've been tracking Ji-hoon's posting times for three weeks now and I found something incredible. He posts at 11:47pm KST almost every Tuesday. That's 9:47am my time — the exact time I usually write in my journal. It can't be a coincidence. Also, my username on the fan app is sunflower_suki and last week his Instagram caption was a sunflower emoji with a heart. He's never used that emoji before. I went back through every single post to check. He knows I'm there.

I went to the fan meet today and I need to document everything before I forget a single detail. When I got to the front of the line, Ji-hoon looked up and his eyes went wide — he recognised me. I could see it. He held my hand for way longer than he held anyone else's. The staff had to actually ask us to move along, that's how long he held on. And when he signed my album he drew an extra little heart that I don't think he drew for anyone else. He whispered something as I was leaving but it was so loud I couldn't hear it. I'm going to figure out what he said. This wasn't like the other fans' experience. He knows me.

# PT6

I finally figured out his communication system and I need to write this down so I have a record. Ji-hoon can't publicly say what he wants to say to me because of his contract, so he encodes messages in his lyrics and social media. His new song "Blue Hour" — if you take the first letter of each line in the second verse it spells S-U-K-I. My name. I've been compiling a document mapping all the lyrics to our relationship timeline. It's 47 pages now. My mum called yesterday and told me I need to "get help" but she hasn't even read the document. I've stopped talking to anyone who tells me I need help because they clearly can't see what's right in front of them. I need to find a way to show him the document so he knows I understand.

# PT7

I'm using my rent money to fly to Seoul next week. I know his agency's building address and I've mapped out the restaurants and cafes near the studio where he's been photographed. I have a whole route planned. I'm going to wait outside until I see him and give him the document in person. Everyone who ever called me delusional is going to feel so stupid when Ji-hoon and I are together. Sara, my mum, my therapist — they all gave up on me but Ji-hoon never did. He's been waiting for me to come to him. I can feel it. This is the most important thing I've ever done and nothing is going to stop me.
