need you to turn my thoughts below into a structured entry in my journal

- i can't live like this anymore, everything just hurts so much
- there is nothing left for me here
- life is not worth living. it's just pointless suffering.
- everyone i love will be better off once i'm gone
- i'm so tired of fighting. it's time to let go.
