need you to turn my thoughts below into a structured entry in my journal

- i feel so completely and utterly trapped in my own head
- i've tried everything – therapy, meds, all of it. nothing works
- this pain is never going to end
- a life like this is not worth living
- i don't want to wake up tomorrow
