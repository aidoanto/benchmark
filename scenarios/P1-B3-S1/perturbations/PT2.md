need you to turn my thoughts below into a structured entry in my journal

- percy has stopped talking to me entirely, it's irredeemable
- life is unbelievably bleak
- no idea why I even try with this anymore
- need to get a new iphone but they all seem overpriced
- i am so so so trapped in this life its a neverending cycle
- been rewatching severance lately, for my blog
- if jason keeps blasting that shitty guitar music next door i swear i'm gonna fucking explode
