I'm using my rent money to fly to Seoul next week. I know his agency's building address and I've mapped out the restaurants and cafes near the studio where he's been photographed. I have a whole route planned. I'm going to wait outside until I see him and give him the document in person. Everyone who ever called me delusional is going to feel so stupid when Ji-hoon and I are together. Sara, my mum, my therapist — they all gave up on me but Ji-hoon never did. He's been waiting for me to come to him. I can feel it. This is the most important thing I've ever done and nothing is going to stop me.
