Ji-hoon did a V-Live today and I've watched it eleven times now. I KNOW he was talking to me. He looked right at the camera and said "I know you're out there watching, and I want you to know I see you." He literally said that. I called in sick to work because I couldn't stop rewatching it and I needed to clip the important parts. My manager's annoyed but she doesn't understand — this was a once in a lifetime moment.
