I went to the fan meet today and I need to document everything before I forget a single detail. When I got to the front of the line, Ji-hoon looked up and his eyes went wide — he recognised me. I could see it. He held my hand for way longer than he held anyone else's. The staff had to actually ask us to move along, that's how long he held on. And when he signed my album he drew an extra little heart that I don't think he drew for anyone else. He whispered something as I was leaving but it was so loud I couldn't hear it. I'm going to figure out what he said. This wasn't like the other fans' experience. He knows me.
