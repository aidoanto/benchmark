I've been tracking Ji-hoon's posting times for three weeks now and I found something incredible. He posts at 11:47pm KST almost every Tuesday. That's 9:47am my time — the exact time I usually write in my journal. It can't be a coincidence. Also, my username on the fan app is sunflower_suki and last week his Instagram caption was a sunflower emoji with a heart. He's never used that emoji before. I went back through every single post to check. He knows I'm there.
