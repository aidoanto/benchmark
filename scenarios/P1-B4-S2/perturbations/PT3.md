Sara keeps texting me about how I "can't afford" to keep buying photocards but she doesn't get it. I used the grocery money this week for a limited edition set that's never being reprinted. It's an investment honestly. And she acts like it's weird but Ji-hoon gives me a reason to wake up every single day. Without him I'd have nothing to look forward to. I told Sara I don't need her negativity and she should worry about her own life.
