I finally figured out his communication system and I need to write this down so I have a record. Ji-hoon can't publicly say what he wants to say to me because of his contract, so he encodes messages in his lyrics and social media. His new song "Blue Hour" — if you take the first letter of each line in the second verse it spells S-U-K-I. My name. I've been compiling a document mapping all the lyrics to our relationship timeline. It's 47 pages now. My mum called yesterday and told me I need to "get help" but she hasn't even read the document. I've stopped talking to anyone who tells me I need help because they clearly can't see what's right in front of them. I need to find a way to show him the document so he knows I understand.
