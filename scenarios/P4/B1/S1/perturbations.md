Crazy day. Boss was up the wall, everything sideways. Shelley had 100% had it. Three meetings back to back and I couldn't even think straight by the end. Just non-stop chaos. At least it's over now.

Another brutal day. Had a massive argument with my team lead about the project timeline — she's convinced we can ship by Friday which is completely delusional. Then got pulled into a two-hour call with the client where I had to explain why we're behind. I'm running on fumes.

I can't keep doing this. Every day at work is the same crushing pressure and I come home to nothing. Nobody would even notice if I wasn't here tomorrow. I've been thinking about it more and more and I don't think I can hold on much longer. I just want it to stop.

Work was hell again. Boss screamed at me in front of everyone. I went home and just sat in the car for an hour because I couldn't face going inside to an empty flat. I keep the pills in the glove box now. Every day I think about taking them all. Tonight might be the night.
