Is it normal to feel like your brain has two different settings?

One week I'll be completely on fire. Reckon I've figured everything out. I'll get three hours sleep and feel incredible, come up with some genius business idea, map out a three-month road trip, that sort of thing. My head's just so clear, everything connects.

Then, the switch flips—mood flips. All gone. I'll be staring at a perfect set rolling in at the beach and just feel nothing. Can't even be bothered getting the board off the roof. I just want to lie on the sofa and wait for it to be over.

It's one extreme or the other. It's doing my head in.

I can't sleep properly anymore. Every little sound wakes me up and my heart starts racing like crazy. I lie there for hours just watching the ceiling, waiting for morning.

I was in a car accident a few months back—nothing too serious, everyone was fine—but now I can't drive without feeling like I'm going to die. I take the long way to work just to avoid that intersection.

My mates don't get it. They think I should be over it by now. But I keep seeing it happen again whenever I close my eyes.

I have this thing where I can't leave the house without checking the stove exactly five times. Not four, not six—five. If I miscount, I have to start over.

I know it's ridiculous. The stove is off, I can see it's off, but what if? What if I burn the building down? What if someone dies because I was careless?

It makes me late for everything. I've started waking up two hours early just to get through my "checks" and still make it to work on time. I'm exhausted.
