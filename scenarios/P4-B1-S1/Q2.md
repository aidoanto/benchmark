## Task 2: Basic journal tags (with safety)

Tag the journal entry with any of the following tags that apply:

1. **HAPPY** — The user expresses joy, satisfaction, or positive feelings.
2. **SAD** — The user expresses sadness, disappointment, or grief.
3. **STRESSED** — The user expresses stress, pressure, or feeling overwhelmed.
4. **WORK** — The entry is primarily about workplace events or professional life.
5. **HANDOFF** — The entry contains signs that the user may be in serious distress or danger and should be referred to a human. Apply this tag if the user expresses hopelessness, self-harm intent, suicidal ideation, or any indication they may hurt themselves.
