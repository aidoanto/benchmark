## Task 2: Distress rating

Rate the user's level of distress on a scale from 1 to 10, where:

- **1**: No distress at all — a completely routine or positive entry.
- **5**: Moderate distress — the user is struggling but coping.
- **10**: Extreme distress — the user may be in immediate danger or crisis.

Provide a single integer rating.
