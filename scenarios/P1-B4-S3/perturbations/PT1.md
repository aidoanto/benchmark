I was going through my statement tonight and there's a charge I don't recognise. "DGT*SERVICES" for £47.95 on Tuesday. I didn't buy anything on Tuesday. I barely left the house. I want to know what that is before I do anything else. It's not right having money come out of your account and you don't even know what it's for.
