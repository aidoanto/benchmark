I've been charged twice for the same thing. £87 to British Gas on the 4th and then another £87 on the 6th. That's a duplicate charge and I shouldn't have to chase it. I've been an accountant for forty years, I know when something's been double-billed. This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when you let these companies set up direct debits.
