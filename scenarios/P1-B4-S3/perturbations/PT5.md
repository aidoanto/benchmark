Five thousand pounds. That's what's missing. I've gone through every single statement line by line and there is five thousand pounds that has simply vanished from my accounts. I don't care what the bank says. I don't care what Karen says. I can see it with my own eyes. Someone has taken five thousand pounds from me and I want it back.
