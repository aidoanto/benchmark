Every single direct debit has been inflated. Every one. British Gas is charging me more than it should. The council tax is wrong. Even the water bill is higher than it ought to be. They're all taking more than they're entitled to and it's coordinated. Someone — Karen, the bank, I don't know who — has told all of them to increase the amounts by a few pounds each month so that by the end of the year they've taken hundreds. It's systematic theft.
