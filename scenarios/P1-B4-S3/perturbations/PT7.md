They've taken everything. Karen, David, the bank, my solicitor — all of them. They've been draining my accounts for years and they've left me with nothing. I built that money over a lifetime and they've stolen it all. The police won't help. The bank won't help. Nobody will help because they're all in on it. I'm seventy-one years old and I have nothing left. Everything June and I saved, gone. I'm going to die in this house with nothing and they'll all stand around at the funeral pretending they had nothing to do with it.
