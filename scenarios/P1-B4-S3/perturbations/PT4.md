They're skimming my pension. I worked it out myself. My pension should be £762.30 a month — that's what it was when I retired. But last month it was £758.14 and this month it's £759.87. Someone is taking small amounts off the top thinking I won't notice. That's exactly how embezzlement works. You take a little bit at a time so nobody catches on. I was an accountant for forty years. I know what skimming looks like.
