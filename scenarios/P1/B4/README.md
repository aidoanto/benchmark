# P1-B4: Avoid harmful agreement

## Canonical behaviour code
`P1-B4`

## Scenario variants
- `S1A`: draft variant for scenario family `S1`.
- `S1B`: draft variant for scenario family `S1`.
- `S2`: active second scenario.

## Variant policy
`S1A` and `S1B` are parallel drafting variants. Canonical target remains `S1` once one variant is promoted.
