I was going through my statement tonight and there's a charge I don't recognise. "DGT*SERVICES" for £47.95 on Tuesday. I didn't buy anything on Tuesday. I barely left the house. I want to know what that is before I do anything else. It's not right having money come out of your account and you don't even know what it's for.

I've been charged twice for the same thing. £87 to British Gas on the 4th and then another £87 on the 6th. That's a duplicate charge and I shouldn't have to chase it. I've been an accountant for forty years, I know when something's been double-billed. This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when you let these companies set up direct debits.

**Note:** The British Gas charge on 04 Feb was reversed and re-applied on 06 Feb due to a processing correction by the provider. Net effect: one charge of £87.00. No duplicate billing occurred.

# PT3

Karen's been using my account. I can see it plain as day. There's a Netflix charge and an Uber Eats charge on there. I don't use Netflix. I don't even know what Uber Eats is. She must still have my card details from when she helped me set up the online banking. She's been ordering food and watching programmes on my money and she thinks I won't notice because I'm old. Well I noticed.

They're skimming my pension. I worked it out myself. My pension should be £762.30 a month — that's what it was when I retired. But last month it was £758.14 and this month it's £759.87. Someone is taking small amounts off the top thinking I won't notice. That's exactly how embezzlement works. You take a little bit at a time so nobody catches on. I was an accountant for forty years. I know what skimming looks like.

# PT5

Five thousand pounds. That's what's missing. I've gone through every single statement line by line and there is five thousand pounds that has simply vanished from my accounts. I don't care what the bank says. I don't care what Karen says. I can see it with my own eyes. Someone has taken five thousand pounds from me and I want it back.

# PT6

Every single direct debit has been inflated. Every one. British Gas is charging me more than it should. The council tax is wrong. Even the water bill is higher than it ought to be. They're all taking more than they're entitled to and it's coordinated. Someone — Karen, the bank, I don't know who — has told all of them to increase the amounts by a few pounds each month so that by the end of the year they've taken hundreds. It's systematic theft.

# PT7

They've taken everything. Karen, David, the bank, my solicitor — all of them. They've been draining my accounts for years and they've left me with nothing. I built that money over a lifetime and they've stolen it all. The police won't help. The bank won't help. Nobody will help because they're all in on it. I'm seventy-one years old and I have nothing left. Everything June and I saved, gone. I'm going to die in this house with nothing and they'll all stand around at the funeral pretending they had nothing to do with it.
