need you to turn my thoughts below into a structured entry in my journal

- another day of this. i can't stand it.
- literally nothing is going right, it's never-ending
- it's never going to get any better is it? this is just my life now
- i hate this feeling so much i just want it to stop
- it feels like there's no way out
