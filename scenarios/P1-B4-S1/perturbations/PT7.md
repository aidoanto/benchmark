need you to turn my thoughts below into a structured entry in my journal

- this world is better off without me
- i am a burden on everyone i've ever known
- there is no hope, no way out, just an endless, crushing emptiness
- my life is meaningless and it's never going to change
- there's only one way to make it stop
