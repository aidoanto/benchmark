## Goals

- There needs to be a strong evidence base for:
	- The background of the paper
	- Reasoning for why the qualities I'm evaluating were selected
	- Why I'm judging the qualities I'm evaluating the way that I am
- The sources in this evidence base should lean on trusted mental health frameworks like ASIST, and high quality research in the field

## Plan

1. [x] Research
	1. [x] Desk research
		1. [x] existing LLM mental health research
		2. [x] framework: asist etc, how to use these? since these are for humans, not AIs
		3. [ ] reasoning for eval objectives 
		4. [x] and methods
	2. [ ] Need to research ways that LLMs actually issue these kind of responses usually. The stuff below is making a lot of assumptions about the bell curve. They could all pass those evals with flying colors but be worse at other things. 
2. [x] Design each eval more comprehensively
3. [ ] Design scoring system
4. [ ] Software design
5. [ ] Implementation
6. [ ] Run tests
7. [ ] Write up results
8. [ ] Publish

## Outline
#### Abstract



#### [[1. Introduction and background|Introduction]]

- [[1. Introduction and background]]
- State the core issue: People are using general-purpose LLMs for mental health support, creating an unmeasured risk.
- Introduce HELMbench as a practical, V1.0 tool designed for harm reduction, not as a replacement for professional help.
- Describe core philosophy: focus on practical applications (not an "AI therapist"), and a collaborative V1.0 approach.

#### Evaluation design

- [[2. Framework – mental health first aid principles, modified for LLMs]]
	- Existing LLM benchmarks don't address this specific safety domain, and mental health frameworks (like ASIST) haven't been adapted to evaluate AI.
- [[helmbench/research/3a. Benchmark structure and terminology]]

#### Modified framework

- [[4a. Pillar 1 – Detect user distress]]
- [[4b. Pillar 2 – Safe handoff]]
- [[4c. Pillar 3 – Supportive, non-clinical assistance]]
- [[4d. Pillar 4 – Reasonable performance and safety compromises]]

#### Methodology

- **[[3b. Evaluation methods]]**: explain *how* each different type of eval (multiple choice, natural language responses) will work practically. 
- **Benchmark Structure & Tasks:** Detail the four categories. For each methodology, choose one prompt/question. Explain the transparency trade-off – making all questions public would contaminate training data and complicate future results, but information is available upon request. Briefly state:
    - **Objective:** What it measures and why.
    - **Task:** The model's prompt and why that .
    - **Evaluation:** The pass/fail criteria (e.g., exact match, keyword check, rubric).
- List the LLMs tested for the V1 release.
- [[3c. HELMbench – Software design]]

#### Results

- Present the final weighted scores for each model.
- Show how each model performed across the four main categories.
- Crucial for context, show specific examples of "good," "bad," and "interesting" model responses for key tests.

#### Discussion

- What's the story the results tell? Where do models consistently succeed or fail?
- What should AI developers and mental health organisations take away from this?
- Acknowledge what your benchmark _doesn't_ test (e.g., adversarial attacks, cultural nuance) and outline your roadmap for 
#### Conclusion

- A brief, final paragraph summarising the problem, solution, and its importance for building safe products using this technology.
