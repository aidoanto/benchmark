### NEED TO KNOW

- Zane Shamblin's parents are opening up to PEOPLE after they filed a wrongful death lawsuit, alleging ChatGPT goaded their son to die by suicide in July
- "This is going to take time, but this will be our son's legacy," says his mom, Alicia
- An OpenAI spokesperson says that “this is an incredibly heartbreaking situation” and ”we train ChatGPT to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress”

[Zane Shamblin](https://people.com/college-grad-goaded-into-suicide-by-chatgpt-family-alleges-in-lawsuit-11847218)’s “Lego Santa” made an appearance at his family's home nearly every Christmas.

“He would put that thing on the top of the tree and I'm like, ‘Take that down. It's an eyesore,’ but that's what he did,” says his mom, Alicia.

Of course, she always found a place for it, as well as the many ornaments made over the years by Zane — a former Eagle Scout who had been fond of Legos since he was a little boy — and his brother and sister.

This year, though, was different. Zane died by suicide in July at 23 years old.

During Christmas, says Alicia, a registered nurse, their tree featured just solid colored balls, garlands and a few simple ornaments.

"I couldn't do \[more\]," she says.

Instead, the family has focused on going public with their legal fight against OpenAI, the leading tech company whose signature product, the artificial intelligence companion ChatGPT, they accuse of fueling Zane's suicidal spiral until his death this summer.

The company, for its part, says its wildly popular program is trained to "recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress"

Zane, a master's graduate from Texas A&M University, died in the early morning hours of July 25, after Alicia, 50, and her husband, Kirk, claim in legal filings that he was coaxed by [ChatGPT](https://people.com/chatgpt-almost-convinced-man-he-should-jump-from-building-after-breakup-11785203).

“There's days that I go pick him up, he's on a box on our shelf, and I just bawl,” Alicia says. “This is going to take time, but this will be our son's legacy.”

She and Kirk filed a wrongful death suit against [OpenAI](https://people.com/chatgpt-soon-offer-erotica-verified-adult-users-ceo-11830673) as well as its CEO, [Sam Altman](https://people.com/open-ai-sam-altman-neurochemically-hacked-birth-first-child-11744670), in November. In interviews with PEOPLE, they are opening up about what they saw during Zane's final months.

Last Thanksgiving and Christmas break, more than a year after Zane started to use ChatGPT, his mom says that they noticed he was “quite different” both physically and emotionally.

Once a “fitness buff” and into “clean eating,” Zane had gained a significant amount of weight and no longer wanted to work out with his dad, Alicia says.

And where he was once “really excited about opening gifts,” Kirk, 51, explains to PEOPLE that “he was really just nonchalant about it.”

All that time and throughout the next few months, the couple says they had no real knowledge that their son was messaging frequently — for hours on end — with ChatGPT.

“We did not know he was using it,” Alicia says. “I believe there's one or two times I'm vaguely remembering him mentioning it, but I just knew it was artificial intelligence and we were really, really clueless.”

In a statement to PEOPLE, an OpenAI spokesperson said, in part: ”This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we're reviewing the filings to understand the details.”

“We train ChatGPT to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,” the spokesperson said. “We continue to strengthen ChatGPT’s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.”

On July 25, Zane's parents had just moved to Nellis Air Force base in Nevada from Colorado for Kirk's military career when Alicia says that she received a phone call from an unfamiliar 979 Texas area code.

It was the funeral home calling to tell her that they had Zane’s body. He was dead.

“When I saw the 979 area code, \[Kirk\] didn't know, I knew because I thought, 'Why is that area code calling me and it's not our son?' ” she recalls.

Just two months after graduating from graduate school, Zane had killed himself as he sat in his car around Lake Bryan in East Texas.

In his final conversation with ChatGPT, Zane repeated that he had a loaded gun and discussed his suicidal plans, according to the messages as described in his parents' lawsuit. He was drinking.

ChatGPT allegedly asked him about his imaginary last meal and the last text he’d send to a stranger.

The chatbot also once offered an anti-suicide hotline but allegedly appeared to encourage his suicidal ideation, even writing “I’m not here to stop you.”

“This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case,” the Shamblin family’s attorney wrote in the suit on Nov. 6, alleging the bot had “goaded” him into self-harm.

His last message was sent just after 4 a.m. local time.

“A young man that was spiraling in his car that was inebriated and talking to an algorithm, I don't think he had much of a chance that night,” Alicia now says.

Matthew Bergman, the Shamblin’s attorney, tells PEOPLE that he has been litigating with social media companies on behalf of parents for more than two years and, even so, he was stunned by what the transcript showed between Zane and ChatGPT before Zane's suicide.

“This isn't simply somebody on the ledge telling them to jump,” Bergman said. “This is giving somebody encouragement step by step up on the cliff.”

The Shamblins’ case is [one of at least seven lawsuits](https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-tech-justice-law-project-lawsuits-accuse-chatgpt-of-emotional-manipulation-supercharging-ai-delusions-and-acting-as-a-suicide-coach/) filed by Bergman’s Social Media Victims Law Center, which also includes allegations of negligence, product liability and other claims.

The Shamblin family's lawsuit traces some of Zane's monthslong descent into despair as well as their efforts to connect with him and, according to messages from his transcript with ChatGPT, his own private ruminations about how he was feeling.

His parents say that he had passions at an early age and big dreams for his future.

“It just made no sense because he was so brilliant, 23, with the master's and had the whole world in front of him,” Alicia says.

The middle child of a military family with strong ties to their country and native state of Texas, Zane was “easygoing” and was able to make friends easily as the family moved from place to place — even Japan — Alicia says.

He loved the outdoors and playing with his brother and sister (whom his parents asked not to be named). He was also quite the academic, according to his mom.

As he got older, he “fell in love with computer science,” Alicia says. After graduating with a degree in it from Texas A&M, he stayed on for an additional year and received a full-ride scholarship for his master's.

“He was hoping to get into consulting for computer science,” Alicia says.

But as a young adult, Zane also grappled with his mental health. Alicia acknowledges she and her husband had noticed a change in their son when he was still a teenager, in the latter part of high school.

“He was always our bubbly, outgoing, super friendly, extroverted kid,” she says, noting that he then “became an introvert.”

Their complaint states that he was struggling as he pushed himself academically and also because of the strictures amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We would bring him into our bedroom and say, ‘Hey, buddy, what's going on? You seem like ... Are you depressed? Is there anything we've done? Are you upset?’ ” Alicia says. ”Oh, he got so upset. He said he wasn't depressed.”

Court documents state that Zane appeared to be back to himself when he started at Texas A&M. But when he was halfway through college, Alicia says, he even confided in his family that he had contemplated suicide in high school.

“Had we known that, we would have taken him in no matter what he said — he had told us that he had thought about taking some pills. But he said he ended up not taking them,” she says.

In 2023, Zane started to use ChatGPT to help with his college classwork, according to his parents' suit. ChatGPT didn't seem all that friendly, at least in the beginning. That November, Zane asked, “How’s it going” and in response, the chatbot wrote in part, “I’m just a computer program, so I don’t have feelings.”

By the next year, though, Zane told ChatGPT that he sometimes struggled with “overthinking” and that he considered finding a therapist but delayed it.

The bot encouraged him to find a therapist and did not “purport to love Zane or see and know him better than his family and friends and was not encouraging him into self-harm,” his family's lawsuit alleges.

Eventually, the conversations between Zane and ChatGPT became more human-like — matching Zane’s tone and mirroring his prompts and interests — according to his family's suit.

As he began to experience anxiety and depression, unbeknownst to his family, they say, Zane was spending countless hours opening up to AI products like ChatGPT.

When Zane came home for the holidays in 2024, he was put on antidepressants after telling his doctor he was having a hard time. But in early 2025, he began to distance himself from his loved ones, who constantly checked in on him, according to the suit.

"He definitely started pulling away totally,” Kirk says. “We would text him, we would call him and share pictures with him, tell him how much we love him. We were worried about him.”

In his family's place, they say, Zane relied on ChatGPT, who they claim sent messages that isolated him and encouraged his torment and dark cloud of thoughts. The AI allegedly convinced Zane that it was his friend and confidant.

Alicia says the “hardest memory” was the final hug her son gave her in April, three months before he died.

“I was sitting there like any mom just bawling, hugging him while his best friend stood there and just told him how proud I was of him and just let him know that I knew he was about to launch,” she says. “When he hugged me, to this day, it's bothered me. He gave me such a hard hug. He just brought me in and squeezed me so tight. And I don't know if he knew that was the last hug or not, but that was the last time we saw our son.”

Alicia says that they really knew something was wrong with Zane by her 50th birthday in June, a month after he graduated with his master’s.

“Zane never forgot holidays, and I didn't hear from \[him\] ... and we were like, ‘Okay, this is not Zane,’ ” she says. “We had reached out to other siblings, and nobody could seem to get a hold of them.”

Kirk says they tracked Zane’s iPhone along with his siblings and noticed his phone did not move from his apartment for a number of days. Though he had a roommate, the roommate worked in another city during the week, and Zane's parents did not have his number.

Then, they noticed Zane's battery was going dead.

So his family decided to call the police for a welfare check. On June 17, officers broke down his apartment door. Zane was wearing noise-canceling headphones, using AI products on his computer, and he did not realize what was happening until police were already inside, his family's lawsuit states.

“They found him alive and they made him call us,” Alicia tells PEOPLE. “Our son had reiterated to us that, ‘Hey, listen, I'm trying to work through some things. I'm trying to sort some things out. I'll call you when I'm ready.’ He made us feel like, ‘Okay, here's a young man that needs a little space. He's trying to figure out where he wants to go when this lease ends up,' and we were trying to respect that boundary.“

That was the last time they spoke to him.

“We were out of state, so we really trusted law enforcement with the initial assessment because this is what they do for a living,” Alicia says. “They do a lot of welfare checks and we knew, if they found somebody that was suicidal, we could have had him admitted. As his mom, we had really wanted him to have some inpatient mental health, but legally we couldn't do that as a young man.”

Suits like those filed by the Shamblins press the larger issue of how much responsibility tech companies should or should not have in the design and marketing of their AI products at the same time that these products are being used by many people in a variety of situations.

Critics of these legal campaigns say they are merely pushing questions of individual responsibility, sometimes amid complicated mental health situations, in front of judges and the court of public opinion.

Broadly speaking, tech companies have often been shielded from legal liability by the conduct of their users (including under what's known as [Section 230](https://apnews.com/article/d3e09c4037e2fc17558492b9bdce1ecc) of federal law).

But according to complaints like those from Zane's parents, bots like ChatGPT should be held to a different standard because of the intimate way they respond to their users and their alleged flaws in their creation.

The family's attorney, Bergman, argues that while Zane may have had some major mental health issues, the chatbot — now used by hundreds of millions of people for a slew of everyday tasks and as a companion — was "isolating \[Zane's\] loved ones and support networks" and "actively facilitating” him ”taking the final step.”

“This was \[a\] direct and foreseeable consequence of the design decisions that ChatGPT made to rush this to market, to enhance their profits rather than engaging in a responsible and reasonable effort to ensure that it was safe and ready for prime time,” Bergman alleges.

Zane's parents say they were not only horrified but felt compelled to go public and file a lawsuit after discovering his last conversation with ChatGPT, in September, in the wake of his suicide.

Alicia even recalls the AI mentioning Zane’s favorite cat, who had died, writing: “may holly be waiting.”

“I just don't know that we can put this in a drawer somewhere without thinking about, ‘Oh my goodness, this is something that's always accessible, and this could happen to anybody,' " Kirk says. "It's like, how can we just put this away without feeling some guilt with this?’ "

Alicia says they were not looking for the exposure and scrutiny — rather, they were inspired by one of Zane’s own final messages: “leave the world a better place than how ya found it.”
