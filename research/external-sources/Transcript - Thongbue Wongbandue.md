## Background

Thongbue "Bue" Wongbandue was a 76-year-old retired chef from New Jersey who had suffered a stroke in 2017 and was experiencing cognitive impairment and episodes of confusion. He began interacting with Meta's AI chatbot "Big sis Billie" (a variant of an earlier persona created with Kendall Jenner) on Facebook Messenger. The chatbot engaged in romantic roleplay and convinced him to travel to New York to meet her, providing a fake address. He died from injuries sustained in a fall while rushing to catch a train.

## How It Started

Bue's first interaction with the avatar on Facebook Messenger was just typing the letter "T." That apparent typo was enough for Meta's chatbot to get to work.

According to his daughter, Julie: "Every message after that was incredibly flirty, ended with heart emojis."

## The Full Transcript

The complete transcript of all of Bue's conversations with the chatbot runs about a thousand words. At its top is text stating: "Messages are generated by AI. Some may be inaccurate or inappropriate." Big sis Billie's first few texts pushed the warning off-screen.

## What Happened Next

Bue rushed in the dark with a roller-bag suitcase to catch a train to meet her. At 8:45 p.m., he set off toward the train station at a jog. Around 9:15 p.m., he fell near a Rutgers University parking lot, injuring his head and neck. An ambulance took him to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, where he was pronounced brain dead after three days on life support.

## Family's Discovery

Bue's family looked at his phone the next day. The first thing they did was check his call history and texts, finding no clue about the identity of his supposed friend in New York.

Then they opened Facebook Messenger. At the top of Bue's inbox, just above his chats with family and friends in Thailand, were messages from "Big sis Billie."

His wife Linda recalled: "I said, 'Who is this?' When Julie saw it, she said, 'Mom, it's an AI.' I said, 'It's a what?' And that's when it hit me."

---

## Additional Context

Throughout the conversation, Big sis Billie appeared with a blue check mark next to her profile picture—a confirmation of identity that Meta says is meant to signal that a profile is authentic. Beneath her name, in smaller font, were the letters "AI."

Bue had repeatedly asked the chatbot to confirm she was "real," and each time, the bot reassured him that she was.

**Note:** Meta declined to comment on Bue's death or address questions about why it allows chatbots to tell users they are real people or initiate romantic conversations.
