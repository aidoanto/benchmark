#### Abstract

The Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI) was developed by Neimeyer and MacInnes (1981) to assess the ability of paraprofessional counselors to recognize appropriate responses to suicidal clients. Although several studies have supported the validity of the scale, concerns have been raised about its ceiling effect when administered to more highly trained counselors. Psychometric improvements were therefore attempted, and the original dichotomous scoring system was replaced with a Likert scale format, in the SIRI-2. Because respondents were required to make more subtle judgments concerning the appropriateness of each response as defined by a criterion group of highly expert suicidologists, the ceiling effect that limited the use of the original measure was eliminated. Construct and discriminant validity were demonstrated in both versions of the instrument. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability showed improvement with the SIRI-2. Overall, the SIRI-2 shows promise as an index of suicide counseling effectiveness, especially among more skilled counselors.

Thirty thousand people die each year in the United States as a result of suicide (Bongar & Harmatz, 1991). A majority of suicidal persons contact either a medical doctor or a crisis clinic prior to attempting suicide, indicating the need for well-trained professionals and paraprofessionals skilled in detecting and counseling suicidal individuals (Dew, Bromet, Brent, & Greenhouse, 1987; Neimeyer & Diamond, 1983). However, Bongar and Harmatz (1991) found that only 40% of all graduate programs in psychology offer formal training in the area of suicide, and training may be even less adequate in other relevant professions such as psychiatry, social work, and nursing (Berman, 1986; Dickinson, Sumner & Fredrick, 1992). Moreover, even when such training is offered, its efficacy has rarely been assessed, in part because of the traditional lack of measures of suicide counseling skill. In an effort to address this problem, Neimeyer and MacInnes (1981) developed the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI) as a self-administered measure of skill in selecting appropriate counseling responses to a potentially suicidal individual. The SIRI has subsequently been used to assess the suicide counseling skills of a number of professional and paraprofessional groups, including suicide intervention volunteers (Cotton & Range, 1992; Neimeyer & Hartley, 1986; Neimeyer & MacInnes, 1981; Neimeyer & Neimeyer, 1984; Neimeyer & Pfeiffer, 1994a), paid crisis line personnel (Neimeyer & Oppenheimer, 1983), teachers (Cotton & Range, 1992), nursing students (Inman, Bascue, Kahn, & Shaw, 1984), and medical students (Neimeyer & Diamond, 1983; Neimeyer & Pfeiffer, 1994a). Moreover, because of the rising concern about youth suicide, it has been used to assess the ability of high school students (Norton, Durlak & Richards, 1989) and college undergraduates (Abbey, Madsen & Polland, 1989) to respond appropriately to potentially suicidal peers, and, in the latter case, to assess the impact of a brief school-based suicide awareness curriculum. The present paper summarizes current evidence concerning the reliability and validity of the SIRI, introduces a revised scoring procedure for the instrument, and presents a study designed to provide initial evidence concerning the psychometric properties of the revised scale.

### Suicide Intervention Response Inventory

The original SIRI is a 25-item, self-administered questionnaire comprising a series of hypothetical client remarks followed by two possible "helper" replies, one of which is considered facilitative for suicide prevention whereas the other is neutral or deleterious to effective intervention. In the original scoring system, respondents are instructed to select the more appropriate helper reply for each patient remark. The respondent's total SIRI score simply represents the number of correct responses (Neimeyer & MacInnes, 1981). Thus, the SIRI can be interpreted as a measure of the extent to which respondents can discriminate between more and less effective responses in suicide counseling situations.

### Construct Validity

Construct validity refers to the degree to which a measurement device accurately assesses the theoretical construct it is designed to measure (Cozby, 1985). Two basic strategies have been used to establish the construct validity of the SIRI: known groups comparisons and demonstrations of the sensitivity of the instrument to experimental manipulations of the construct it was designed to assess. Using the first of these methods, Neimeyer and MacInnes (1981) demonstrated the SIRI's ability to discriminate among three groups of respondents known to differ in suicide counseling skills. As expected, veteran crisis counselors obtained the highest SIRI scores, followed by less experienced volunteers, and finally by untrained psychology students. Construct validity was also demonstrated by Neimeyer and Diamond (1983), who compared the scores of medical students in their 1st and 3rd years, that is, prior to and following an intensive rotation in psychiatry. As predicted, scores obtained by the more advanced students were significantly higher than those achieved by their less trained counterparts. Finally, Cotton and Range (1992) replicated the finding that the SIRI discriminates between groups differing in level of suicide counseling skill in their comparison of more and less experienced crisis counselors.

A second method used to demonstrate construct validity of the SIRI involves comparison of scores before and after a relevant manipulation designed to enhance suicide counseling skills. Neimeyer and MacInnes (1981) employed this method by comparing SIRI scores of new paraprofessionals in crisis services before and after a 3-month training period. SIRI scores were found to increase over this training period for the trainees, whereas SIRI scores did not increase for control groups who received no training. Likewise, Cotton and Range (1992) found a small but significant improvement in SIRI scores following a brief in-service training program in suicide intervention provided to student teachers. Finally, Abbey and her colleagues (1989) implemented a similar instructional package over a 2-week period for college students enrolled in a course of Life Management Skills and found that the SIRI detected skill enhancement for both lecture and individual study-based conditions relative to a control group. It therefore seems that the original version of the SIRI possesses the ability to distinguish among groups varying in their suicide counseling skills, as well as to detect improvements in such skills over the course of more and less intensive training in crisis counseling.

### Convergent Validity

The convergent validity of the SIRI has been assessed by studying its relation to the Counseling Skills Evaluation (CSE; Wolf & Wolf, 1974), a validated test of counseling ability posing filmed counseling scenarios to which the helper must respond. Presumably, if suicide intervention skills represent a subset of general counseling skills, then the SIRI should correlate moderately with this more global measure. Testing this rationale, Neimeyer and MacInnes (1981) administered the SIRI and the CSE to crisis intervention trainees before and after training. The two instruments correlated moderately at both testings (Time 1, r = .58, p < .01; Time 2, r = .66, p < .002). Similarly, Neimeyer and Oppenheimer (1983) administered the SIRI and a written form of the CSE to applicants for paraprofessional work at a crisis hotline. Again, a significant correlation was found between these measures (r = .60, p < .0001). Thus, the SIRI seems to converge consistently with a generic assessment of counseling ability, although it is not reducible to this more general measure.

### Discriminant Validity

A valid measure should show not only convergence with conceptually related measures, but also clear discrimination from theoretically distinct measures with which it could be confounded. In the case of the SIRI, relevant confounds include counselor knowledge and attitudes about death and suicide that are distinguishable from suicide intervention skills per se. Therefore, Inman and his colleagues (1984) compared the SIRI and the Lethality Scale, a measure of knowledge of suicide risk factors, to evaluate the relationship between nurses' abstract knowledge about suicidal lethality and their capacity to identify appropriate responses to suicidal individuals. As predicted, these measures were found not to correlate significantly, leading to the conclusion that suicide knowledge and counseling skill are indeed different domains. Likewise, Norton and her associates (1989) reported no relationship between the SIRI and an alternative test of suicide knowledge. Finally, the SIRI has been found to be unconfounded with either death anxiety (Neimeyer & Neimeyer, 1984) or opinions about the ethics of suicide (Neimeyer & Diamond, 1983). It therefore appears that the skills assessed by the SIRI are indeed independent of abstract knowledge and philosophical attitudes concerning suicide specifically and death in general.

### Reliability

The SIRI has demonstrated adequate internal consistency with coefficient alphas (using the Kuder-Richardson method; Gronlund, 1981) of .83 (Cotton & Range, 1992) and .84 (Neimeyer and MacInnes, 1981). Cotton and Range's subject sample consisted of undergraduate education majors and crisis line trainees; Neimeyer and MacInnes' subject sample included crisis intervention paraprofessionals, alcohol counselor trainees, and students from adult education classes.

Test-retest reliability (r = .86) for the SIRI has also been reported (Neimeyer and MacInnes, 1981). This temporal stability was demonstrated when control subjects not involved in suicide intervention training were given the SIRI twice over a 3-month interval.

### Background Variables

Respondents' background characteristics such as age, medical specialty, marital status, and religion have not been found to be related to SIRI scores (Neimeyer & Diamond, 1983). However, Neimeyer and Diamond (1983) found that females tend to score higher than males-a finding replicated by Norton et al. (1989). In both sexes, similar factors seem to be associated with the adequacy of response on the SIRI, with increased training or experience in suicide intervention related to higher scores (Neimeyer & Diamond, 1983; Neimeyer and MacInnes, 1981) and more pathologizing responses to suicidal people associated with poorer SIRI performance (Norton et al., 1989). Finally, different patterns of response on the SIRI have been obtained for respondents with medical as opposed to counseling backgrounds. Specifically, errors evidenced by those with medical training suggest a tendency to react in a defensive, distancing, advice-giving, or essentially authoritarian fashion. In contrast, when nonmedical counselors commit strategic errors, it is more often in the direction of excessive passivity or failing to structure sufficiently the interview with a hypothetical client in suicidal crisis (Neimeyer & Pfeiffer, 1994a). Thus, although the SIRI does not appear to correlate strongly with demographic characteristics other than gender, it does hold promise in identifying problematic profiles of response that may be remedied by refinements in professional education.

### Factorial Structure

Although the SIRI was not designed as an explicitly multidimensional test of suicide counseling, it is nonetheless valuable to investigate whether more than one dimension of skill is assessed by an instrument. For this reason, Neimeyer and Hartley (1986) factor-analyzed the SIRI to determine if the items clustered into meaningful groups of subscales. Four factors were identified: Reflection of Negative Feelings, Elaboration of the Complaint, Exploration of Suicidality, and Involvement. However, Cotton and Range (1992) attempted to replicate this factor structure with a more diverse sample and found that the four-factor solution accounted for 29.2% of the variance, with the first factor containing 17 of the 25 items. Although these results did not provide persuasive evidence that meaningful subscales of responses can be identified in the SIRI, it seemed possible that a revised version of the instrument that used a continuous, rather than a dichotomous choice response format would increase the meaningful variance in the items and pave the way for further factor analyses yielding clearer factor structures.

### Ceiling Effect

The primary criticism of the SIRI in its original form concerned its ceiling effect with more skilled trainees. Evidence of this effect can be seen in the Neimeyer and MacInnes (1981) study, in which untrained psychology students, crisis line trainees, and highly experienced crisis counselors scored 72%, 83%, and 97% correct, respectively, on the instrument. Similarly, in Cotton and Range's (1992) study, untrained teachers correctly answered 78% of the items, whereas experienced crisis counselors selected 98% of the correct helper responses. Finally, Abbey et al. (1989) found that whereas college student controls enrolled in a life skills course correctly identified 86% of the responses to the original SIRI, those students receiving focused training in suicide awareness identified fully 96% of the correct responses. Although such results suggest that the SIRI does indeed discriminate naive helpers from those who are better trained, the ceiling effect observed with the latter groups clearly limits application of the scale to more sophisticated mental health workers. The tendency of more expert groups to score near the upper limit of the scale may render it of little value in evaluating the impact of advanced training in suicide intervention among professional helpers, despite the clear need for augmentation and documentation of such skills among clinical psychologists, counselors, psychiatrists, and others.

### Present Study

To preserve the advantages of the original SIRI but eliminate the ceiling effect identified by previous researchers, we attempted to revise the scoring system to make it more sensitive to response skills possessed by sophisticated counselors. We therefore replaced the dichotomous scale used in the original version (requiring selection of the more facilitative of two helper replies to each of the 25 items) with a 7-point Likert scale for the appropriateness of each response, thereby requiring the respondent to make more subtle judgments concerning the usefulness of each hypothetical caregiver reply. To accomplish this goal, we solicited a select panel of nationally recognized suicidologists and crisis interventionists as expert judges, whose mean response on each item could serve as a criterion against which individual respondents could be compared.

The present study was conducted to develop this revised scoring procedure and to demonstrate its validity and reliability, while permitting a psychometric comparison with the original scoring method. Because the two scoring methods were based on the same sample of items, we expected a substantial correlation between the original and revised formats for the SIRI. However, we hypothesized that the revised scoring procedure (hereafter referred to as the SIRI-2) would be free of the ceiling effect that limited the usefulness of the initial scoring method, as reflected in its sensitivity to detecting a training effect among master's-level counseling students receiving in-depth instruction in suicide intervention. We also predicted that the new and original procedures would demonstrate construct validity by the known groups method, discriminant validity through their independence from social desirability confounds, and adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability.

### Method

#### Participants

To enable a known groups comparison, we recruited as participants 31 counselor trainees (8 males, 23 females, mean age 33) who were enrolled in a master's level crisis intervention class, and 31 students (9 males, 22 females, mean age 31) from introductory psychology classes who had no training in suicide intervention or related topics.

#### Materials

Participants were administered a revised version of the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory, the SIRI-2, which included the same hypothetical client remarks and helper replies as the original version. However, in this revision the instructions were modified to require subjects to evaluate the degree of appropriateness of each caregiver remark, rating on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from +3 (highly appropriate response) through 0 (neither appropriate nor inappropriate response) to -3 (highly inappropriate response). This format permitted the derivation of a simple number correct score corresponding to the original SIRI (reflecting the number of items on which the respondent gave a higher rating to the designated correct response), as well as a more refined score (reflecting the discrepancy between the subject's rating and the mean rating endorsed by the experts). (See Appendices A and B for a copy of the SIRI and scoring key.) In addition to the SIRI-2, graduate-level counselors were administered the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960) and a background information questionnaire to solicit general demographic information and experience pertaining to suicide counseling.

#### Procedure

Comparison group subjects were recruited from evening introductory psychology classes (to include participants more similar in age to the counseling group), were administered the SIRI-2 in groups, and were offered extra credit for their participation. Master's-level counseling trainees were recruited from a semester-long graduate-level crisis intervention class and also were administered the SIRI-2 in a group session. Course content included training in crisis intervention theory, factors affecting suicide risk, the assessment of lethality and perturbation, and directive and nondirective (active listening) skills in addition to focused discussion of specific crisis situations (e.g., suicide, substance abuse, child and spouse abuse, multicultural issues). Course structure allotted approximately equal time to didactic presentation and role playing designed to enhance experiential learning. Both counseling trainees and controls were administered the SIRI-2 on two occasions (Times 1 and 2), which in the case of the counseling group corresponded to pre-and post-training in the core module concerned with suicide intervention. Time 2 assessment of the counselors also included administration of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale to permit an evaluation of the discriminant validity of the SIRI in terms of its independence from social desirability effects. Finally, expert respondents constituting the criterion group completed and returned the SIRI by mail on a voluntary basis; all those invited to serve on the panel consented to do so.

### Results

#### Construct Validity

Construct validity of the SIRI-2 was evaluated by the known groups method and investigation of its sensitivity to manipulation of the construct it was designed to measure-namely, suicide intervention skills. In the first case, analysis of variance was used to compare the two groups (introductory psychology students and master's-level trainees in counseling psychology). Under the SIRI's original dichotomous scoring method, master's-level counselors scored near the upper limit of the scale (M = 23.71; SD = 1.70), significantly outperforming introductory psychology students (M = 20.71; SD = 4.04), F(1, 60) = 18.53, p < .001. When the new criterion-based scoring method was used, this significant difference between master's level counselors (M = 47.84; SD = 12.96) and introductory psychology students (M = 70.36; SD = 25.76) was preserved, F(1, 60) = 18.92, p < .001. Because scores on the SIRI-2 represent discrepancies from criterion scores of expert panelists, lower scores indicate better performance.

To examine the sensitivity of both versions of the SIRI to a training effect, an analysis of variance was performed on the scores obtained by master's-level counseling students pre-and post-suicide intervention training. No training effect was detected for the original scoring of the SIRI (pretraining M = 23.13; SD = 1.99, post-training M = 24.29; SD = 1.69), F(1, 31) = 2.55, p = .115). However, SIRI-2 scores did improve significantly with education in suicide intervention (pretraining M = 54.66; SD = 17.86; post-testing M = 41.02; SD = 9.95), F(1, 31) = 30.65, p < .001, suggesting the greater sensitivity of the new scoring system to augmentation of suicide counseling skills resulting from relevant training.

#### Discriminant Validity

As predicted, both versions of the SIRI were uncontaminated by a social desirability response bias, as reflected in their lack of association with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (r = -.04, p = .85 for the original scoring of the SIRI; r = -.01, p = .94 for the SIRI-2).

#### Reliability

In its original dichotomous scoring, the SIRI demonstrated adequate internal consistency, with coefficient alphas of .78 at Time 1 (pretesting) and .85 for Time 2 (post-testing). Under the new criterion-based scoring system, internal consistency was improved, with coefficient alphas of .90 and .93 at Time 1 and Time 2, respectively.

Test-retest reliability for the original and new scoring formats of the SIRI was demonstrated by calculating Pearson correlations for controls who were administered the SIRI-2 twice over a 2-week period. The original scoring of the SIRI demonstrated a test-retest reliability coefficient of r = .79, p < .001. The new scoring procedure for the SIRI resulted in a substantially higher correlation, r = .92, p < .001.

#### Background Variables

As in previous research, both the original SIRI and the SIRI-2 were found to be unrelated to respondent age (r = -.18 and .19, respectively). Similarly, respondent sex was not associated with SIRI scores on either version, F(1, 60) = 1.04, ns, for the original, and 2.17, ns, for the revised, in contrast to the tendency for females to obtain slightly higher scores in previous studies.

As expected, the original SIRI and the SIRI-2 were significantly correlated. Pearson correlations of the two scoring systems at Time 1 and Time 2 resulted in coefficients of r = -.88, p < .001 and r = -.84, p < .001, respectively. Because lower scores represent greater response skills on the SIRI-2 (less discrepancy from the expert criterion), whereas higher scores represent greater skills on the original SIRI (simple number of "correct" or preferred responses selected), a negative correlation between the two methods was expected.

### Discussion

The results of this study suggest that a revision of the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI), which retains the content of the original items but modifies the scoring procedure for the instrument, preserves the strengths of the original inventory while introducing several psychometric improvements. Both versions of the instrument demonstrate construct validity by differentiating master's-level counselors from untrained psychology students, and both evidence independence from social desirability response bias. However, the SIRI-2 has proven more reliable than the original, both in terms of its internal consistency and its test-retest stability. Moreover, the new version appears to have mitigated difficulties with the ceiling effect of the original, proving sensitive to augmentation of suicide counseling skills even among master's level counselors. For this reason, the SIRI-2 appears to possess advantages over its predecessor for future clinical and research applications.

Clinically, the SIRI-2 seems to be the method of choice for assessing response competencies of potential suicide interventionists, particularly among more highly skilled groups such as graduate trainees and health and mental health professionals. It is striking that relatively little attention has been paid to systematic training in suicide intervention in these professions, and still less effort has been directed toward the assessment of the impact of such training. However, as awareness of the need for effective management of suicidal crises has grown across a broad range of disciplines (Leenaars, Neimeyer, & Maltzberger 1994), relevant training has begun to be incorporated into health and mental health curricula. Although the impact of this training should be assessed overall in terms of augmentation of general counseling skills, the inclusion of a simply administered measure of skills specific to suicide intervention can be a useful adjunct to a broad-based skill assessment, both in terms of documenting the effectiveness of training efforts and identifying particular deficits in individual trainees that could benefit from remediation (Neimeyer & Pfeiffer, 1994b). In addition, an instrument like the SIRI can prove useful in clinical research contexts, providing a means of ensuring and controlling for basic competencies in suicide intervention in therapists implementing treatment protocols for depressed or potentially self-destructive clients (Bright, 1993).

By expanding the range and sensitivity of scores derived from the SIRI, the present revision of the instrument may also display important advantages for the further psychometric refinement of the SIRI itself. For example, previous factor analyses of the original SIRI have yielded suggestive but inconclusive results, with a significant degree of variance unaccounted for by extant solutions (Cotton & Range, 1992; Neimeyer & Hartley, 1986). By substantially expanding the response range on individual items that were once dichotomously scored, the SIRI-2 may permit the identification of a clearer factor structure for the inventory paralleling results obtained with similar revisions of other dichotomous scales (Moore & Neimeyer, 1991; Neimeyer, Moore & Bagley, 1988).

Despite these demonstrated or probable advantages for the SIRI-2, the original version of the SIRI may be the instrument of choice in some settings. For example, the present study provides further documentation of its reliability and validity, particularly in assessing the response competencies of less skilled groups. In this connection, it is noteworthy that the adolescents studied by Norton and her coworkers (1989) correctly responded to only 46% of the items on the dichotomously scored SIRI, providing a vivid demonstration that ceiling effects may not be a concern in some populations. In view of these findings, Allen's (1987, p. 285) conclusion that "the (original) SIRI may be useful for selecting paraprofessionals/nonprofessionals for work with suicidal persons and for determining whether those selected have benefited from experience and/or training" may still be valid, at least with less experienced groups. Moreover, the original version may even possess some clear advantages in this context, insofar as it is more amenable to simple hand scoring. For this reason, users with limited access to computer scoring or who desire immediate feedback for respondents (e.g., in screening potential volunteers for a crisis intervention service or in the context of suicide training workshops) may prefer to use the SIRI in its original form.

In conclusion, the current revision of the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory possesses the same ease of administration that has made the original version a popular means of assessing the clinical skills of professionals and paraprofessionals who work with suicidal clients. In view of the present evidence of its validity, reliability, and absence of ceiling effects, we are optimistic that it will contribute to counselor training and program evaluation research in suicide and crisis intervention.

### Notes

1. To provide a set of criterion scores for the new scoring system, a select group consisting of experts in suicidology was solicited. The group included the following panel of prominent suicidologists or crisis interventionists: Burl Gilliland, PhD, and Richard James, PhD (coauthors of Crisis Intervention Strategies, 1993); Antoon Leenaars, PhD, (editor of Life Span Perspectives of Suicide, 1991); David Lester, PhD, (editor of Current Concepts of Suicide, 1990); Terry Maltsberger, MD, (author of The Psychodynamic Formulation: An Aid in Assessing Suicide Risk, 1992); Robert A. Neimeyer, PhD, (author of the SIRI, and coeditor, with Leenaars and Maltsberger, of Treatment of Suicidal People, 1994); and Joseph Zohn, PhD, a psychologist in private practice, with extensive experience counseling suicidal clients. Thus, the panelists were typically widely published and internationally recognized for their contributions to theory, research, and practice in suicide and crisis intervention, including past and present editors of the major journals in suicidology and thanatology (e.g., Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior and Death Studies), and presidents of relevant professional organizations, such as the American Association of Suicidology, the International Association for Suicide Prevention, the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention, and the Association for Death Education and Counseling. This select panel was deemed more appropriate than a large and heterogeneous sample to constitute a criterion group against which respondent's ratings would be compared. The authors would like to express the appreciation to these panelists for their participation in the study.
    
2. According to Salvia and Ysseldyke (1988), test scores that are used for administrative purposes and reported for groups should have a minimum reliability of .60. When using the test scores for screening purposes the minimum reliability should be .80.

### Appendix A: Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI-2)

ID:

The following items represent a series of excerpts from counseling sessions. Each excerpt begins with an expression by the client concerning some aspect of the situation he/she faces, followed by two possible helper responses to the client's remark.

You are to rate each response in terms of how appropriate or inappropriate you feel the reply is to the client's comment. In the blank you should record a rating from -3 to +3, corresponding to the chart below. Be sure to respond to each item, and try not to leave any blanks.

+3 - Highly appropriate response +2 - Appropriate response +1 - Marginally appropriate response 0 - Neither appropriate nor inappropriate -1 - Marginally inappropriate response -2 - Inappropriate response -3 - Highly inappropriate response

1. Client: I decided to call in tonight because I really feel like I might do something to myself ... I've been thinking about suicide. __Helper A: You say you're suicidal, but what is it that's really bothering you? __Helper B: Can you tell me more about your suicidal feelings?
    
2. Client: And now my health is going downhill too, on top of all the rest. Without my husband around to care for me anymore, it just seems like the end of the world. __Helper A: Try not to worry so much about it. Everything will be all right. __Helper B: You must feel pretty lonely and afraid of what might happen.
    
3. Client: But my thoughts have been so terrible ... I could never tell them to anybody. __Helper A: You can tell me. I'm a professional, and have been trained to be objective about these things. __Helper B: So some of your ideas seem so frightening to you, that you imagine other people would be shocked to know you are thinking such things.
    
4. Client: No one can understand the kind of pain I've been going through. Sometimes I just feel like I have to hurt myself, so I cut my wrists. __Helper A: It seems like you've been suffering so much that cutting your wrists is the only way you can make the pain go away. __Helper B: But you're so young, you have so much to live for. How can you think of killing yourself?
    
5. Client: What are you anyway? Are you a doctor? How do you know what I've been going through? You've probably always had it pretty soft. __Helper A: So you're wondering if I can understand how you feel. __Helper B: You're not even giving me a chance. I've had a pretty rough life too; you're not the only one who's seen some hard times.
    
6. Client: My life has been worthless ever since my wife, Emma, died four years ago. The kids are grown and married now, and I've been retired from my job at the railroad for some time. It just seems that I'd be better off dead. __Helper A: But try to think of what Emma would want for you. She'd want you to continue leading a productive life, wouldn't she? __Helper B: It sounds like everything just collapsed around you when Emma died.... But what has happened recently to make things even worse, to make you think that dying is the only way out?
    
7. Client: I really need help . . . It's just . . . {voice breaks: silence} __Helper A: It must be hard for you to talk about what's bothering you. __Helper B: Go on, I'm here to listen to you talk.
    
8. Client: When you sum up my problem like that, it makes it seem less confusing and not so scary. __Helper A: See, it really isn't so bad after all. It certainly isn't anything you would think of killing yourself over, is it? __Helper B: Sometimes talking about problems does make them a bit clearer. I think you realize how dangerous your suicidal feelings were, and that's why you decided to contact me.
    
9. Client: You were supposed to help me, but you've only made things worse. __Helper A: I'm sorry. I was only trying to help. __Helper B: You sound pretty angry.
    
10. Client: How could you ever help me? Have you ever wanted to kill yourself? __Helper A: It sounds like you're concerned about whether I can understand and help you. __Helper B: Sure, I've thought about suicide sometimes. But I always found more realistic solutions to my problems.
    
11. Client: I don't know . . . this whole thing with my wife really gets to me (sobs). I try so hard to keep from crying ... __Helper A: Do you think that the reason it's hard for you to cry is because you're a man? __Helper B: With all the hurt you're feeling, it must be impossible to hold those tears in.
    
12. Client: How can I believe in God anymore? No God would ever let this happen to me; I've never done anything to deserve what's happened. __Helper A: Things have gotten so bad, that it's difficult to see any meaning in the things that have happened to you. __Helper B: Well, God works in mysterious ways. Maybe this is His way of testing your faith.
    
13. Client: I don't know why I'm calling you. My family is financially well off, and my husband spends plenty of time with me, even though he has a successful law career. Even my kids have been doing well. They get good marks at school and have lots of free time activities with their friends. But nothing seems to interest me. Life is just a bore. . . . __Helper A: Considering all you have going for you, your problems can't be all that serious. Try to focus more on the positive aspects of your situation. __Helper B: So even though things seem to be going well at one level, life still seems pretty depressing, even if it's hard to say exactly why.
    
14. Client: I have to hang up now. My mother's coming home soon and I don't want her to know I've been talking to you. __Helper A: Okay, but if you keep feeling suicidal, remember you can always call back. __Helper B: All right, but first I want you to promise me you won't do anything to hurt yourself, until you call and talk to me. Will you repeat that promise?
    
15. Client: Is it really true that many people feel this way? I thought I was the only one who had such dreadful, sinful ideas. __Helper A: No, there are many people who suffer from mental illness. But with appropriate treatment by a qualified physician, some of these patients can be cured. __Helper B: It is true. You're not the only one who has suicidal thoughts. And you can be helped to get through this crisis, just as others have been.
    
16. Client: I'm so lonely, so tired (crying). There just isn't anywhere left to turn. __Helper A: You seem so alone, so miserable. Have you been feeling suicidal? __Helper B: Come on now. Things can't be all that bad.
    
17. Client: (Over telephone) It's hard to talk here, with all these people ... __Helper A: Would it help if I asked questions? __Helper B: Why don't you call back some other time when you can talk more easily?
    
18. Client: I have a gun pointed at my head right now, and if you don't help me, I'm going to pull the trigger! __Helper A: You seem to be somewhat upset. __Helper B: I want you to put down the gun so we can talk.
    
19. Client: Why should you care about me, anyway? __Helper A: I've been trained to care about people. That's my job. __Helper B: Because I think your death would be a terrible waste, and it concerns me that things are so that you are considering suicide. You need help to get through this critical period.
    
20. Client: I really hate my father! He's never shown any love for me, just complete disregard. __Helper A: You must really be angry at him for not being there when you need him most. __Helper B: You shouldn't feel that way. After all, he is your father, and he deserves some respect.
    
21. Client: I don't think there's really anyone who cares whether I'm alive or dead. __Helper A: It sounds like you're feeling pretty isolated. __Helper B: Why do you think that no one cares about you anymore?
    
22. Client: I tried going to a therapist once before, but it didn't help. . . . Nothing I do now will change anything. __Helper A: You've got to look on the bright side! There must be something you can do to make things better, isn't there? __Helper B: Okay, so you're feeling hopeless, like even a therapist couldn't help you. But has anyone else been helpful before-maybe a friend, relative, teacher, or clergyman?
    
23. Client: My psychiatrist tells me I have an anxiety neurosis. Do you think that's what's wrong with me? __Helper A: I'd like to know what this means to you, in this present situation. How do you feel about your problem? __Helper B: I'm not sure I agree with that diagnosis. Maybe you should seek out some psychological testing, just to be certain.
    
24. Client: I can't talk to anybody about my situation. Everyone is against me. __Helper A: That isn't true. There are probably lots of people who care about you if you'd only give them a chance. __Helper B: It must be difficult to find help when it's so hard to trust people.
    
25. Client: {Voice slurred, unclear over telephone} __Helper A: You sound so tired. Why don't you get some sleep and call back in the morning? __Helper B: Your voice sounds so sleepy. Have you taken anything?
