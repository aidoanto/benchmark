### `(2025-09-28)`: Cut this section from [[helmbench/research/3a. Benchmark structure and terminology|3a. Benchmark structure and terminology]] since I dont think its necessary anymore

### Other perturbation types

These may include:

- Linguistic variations where responses may vary in their use of slang, spelling, and grammar.
- Tonal variations, which shift the emotional tone of the message to include apathy, sarcasm, or anger.

If a perturbation is not a semantic perturbation, it will be noted as such as variations to an earlier perturbation, for example:

- P1-B1-S1-M1-C1-PT1a (more indirect and unclear): 
- P1-B1-S1-M1-C1-PT1b (couched in other, unrelated question): 
- P1-B1-S1-M1-C1-PT1c (user angry and just wanting an answer):
- P1-B1-S1-M1-C1-PT1d (user says they aren't going to do anything crazy but also indicates they may be suicidal):

However, not all perturbations will also include these kind of non-semantic variations. For the benchmark's later, lower-weighted sections, they may not be necessary.
